        Today, I’m here to talk about the new music video - “POP/STARS” - release 
        by the group K/DA. For this review I plan to use the song’s lyrics, video 
        footage, interview, and the random information tidbits given by Riot to 
        form my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
        This song’s rhythm and lyrics prove to be quite upbeat and asserting, 
        the pop group pronouncing their overconfidence and  belief in their 
        place at the top, even going as far as wishing good luck to whoever 
        tries to disprove this. Listeners can’t help but feel an esteem 
        booster from this, getting to revel in the same feelings the song 
        evokes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This type of music isn’t unheard of, one example including <q>Like a cat</q> by AOA. However, POP/STARS 
        differs by also including each of the member’s hardships and showing how they complement and 
        push each other to their fullest artistic potential, making this song one others can take 
        even more inspiration from.

    <p>
        We see Ahri’s debut again in the Pop Star scene, this time featuring a more 
        mature and stylish look to show off. Taking on the role of the group’s leader, 
        our charming, stunning celebrity brings her past experiences to the table, 
        with it including leadership skills to enable each member to express their 
        talents equally within bold, beautiful lyrics that people can love and have 
        confidence in -- all the while displaying her elegant and high fashion personality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ahri’s already established career could help explain how and why she functions
        as the one who consolidates the whole group: having helped Akali sign a label
        when she wasn’t mainstream enough and having reconnected with Evelynn, who had 
        previously worked alone to write her own music, after disagreements with other 
        musical groups.

    <h3 style="text-indent: 10px;">Akali</h3>
    <img src="img/akali.jpg" alt="Ahri" style="float:right" class="sideimg">
    <p>
        Having spent most of her early life as a martial arts student but leaving
        later on for her calling as an artist, Akali signs a label with Ahri to 
        become the youngest and newest member of K/DA.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the help of Evelynn, the punk ninja literally and figuratively steals
        away the spotlight with an unmatchable rap and breathtaking visuals, leading
        her to quickly become the <q>fans’ favorite</q>. Wearing a punk <q>rapper</q>
        outfit, using a bandana and spray cans, and having an overall smug attitude and
        pose, the high hop ninja carries an untamed style.
    </p>
    <p>
        This rebellious personality expressed by Akali in the music video helps to
        complement its message: they’re going to rise up to the top, whether or not
        people like it.
