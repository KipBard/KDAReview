<section class="intro">
    <p>
        Today, I’m here to talk about the new music video - “POP/STARS” - release 
        by the group K/DA. For this review I plan to use the song’s lyrics, video 
        footage, interview, and the random information tidbits given by Riot to 
        form my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
        This song’s rhythm and lyrics prove to be quite upbeat and asserting, 
        the pop group pronouncing their overconfidence and  belief in their 
        place at the top, even going as far as wishing good luck to whoever 
        tries to disprove this. Listeners can’t help but feel an esteem 
        booster from this, getting to revel in the same feelings the song 
        evokes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This type of music isn’t unheard of, one example including <q>Like a cat</q> by AOA. However, POP/STARS 
        differs by also including each of the member’s hardships and showing how they complement and 
        push each other to their fullest artistic potential, making this song one others can take 
        even more inspiration from.
    </p>

    <h3>Ahri</h3>
        <img src="img/ahrimid.jpg" alt="Ahri" class="sideimg">
    <p>
        We see Ahri’s debut again in the Pop Star scene, this time featuring a more 
        mature and stylish look to show off. Taking on the role of the group’s leader, 
        our charming, stunning celebrity brings her past experiences to the table, 
        with it including leadership skills to enable each member to express their 
        talents equally within bold, beautiful lyrics that people can love and have 
        confidence in -- all the while displaying her elegant and high fashion personality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ahri’s already established career could help explain how and why she functions
        as the one who consolidates the whole group: having helped Akali sign a label
        when she wasn’t mainstream enough and having reconnected with Evelynn, who had 
        previously worked alone to write her own music, after disagreements with other 
        musical groups.

    <img src="img/akalimid.jpg" alt="Akali" class="sideimg">
    <p>
        Having spent most of her early life as a martial arts student but leaving
        later on for her calling as an artist, Akali signs a label with Ahri to 
        become the youngest and newest member of K/DA.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the help of Evelynn, the punk ninja literally and figuratively steals
        away the spotlight with an unmatchable rap and breathtaking visuals, leading
        her to quickly become the fans’ favorite. Wearing a punk rapper
        outfit, using a bandana and spray cans, and having an overall smug attitude and
        pose, the high hop ninja carries an untamed style.
    </p>
    <p>
        This rebellious personality expressed by Akali in the music video helps to
        complement its message: they’re going to rise up to the top, whether or not
        people like it.

    <h3>Evelynn</h3>
    <p>
        Known for being a demanding artist with an uncompromising vision, Evelynn doesn't accept anything that isn't short of perfection.
        This strict attitude has lead the diva to have difficulty working with previous musical groups, due to creative 
        differences. However, with Ahri's leadership, the POP industry's spotlight is cast once again upon Evelynn.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mindset Evelynn has can make her troublesome to work with, her turbulent presence in the industry being met with a diehard
        fan base, but the Siren's other side that isn't often talked about is her friendship values, being close to few people and 
        very protective of them. While Akali was writing the rap for <q>POP/STARS</q>, Ahri encouraged her to go further, meanwhile, 
        Evelynn was more direct in her advice, possibly leading Akali to perform to her fullest potential.
    </p>
    <p>
        Evelynn has been romantically linked with several missing male celebrities but never has confirmed a relationship, declining
        to comment on the subject whenever it is brought up on interviews.

    <h3>Kai'sa</h3>
    <p>
        Recognized as the dreamer of the group, Kai'sa aspires the group to aim for the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having lived in ten countries before pursuing her dream of becoming a pop star, Kai'sa ensures
        the group never has a boring dance practice by bringing international style to its coreography.
        Kai'sa was also responsible for the spray painted art contrasted by black light that appears during
        Akali's rap section, showing how there's so much more than what meets the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a reply to a question made on social media, Kai'sa described her motive to dance as being like a 
        call from the void, hungry and demanding for release, stirring a symphony of movement in her
        as the music begins. A story to leave the void behind, and fall back into the steps of life, as her body
        reacts to its call.
